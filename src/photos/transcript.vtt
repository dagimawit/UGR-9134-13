How many organs are there in the body, so many cancers are there.
0:16
Cancer is just a name, but there are so many types, so many sub-types, and so many technical
0:23
things.
0:24
I won't go in detail, but broadly, you can name the organ, and there is a cancer for
0:28
that organ.
0:29
For example, brain.
0:31
There is a brain tumour.
0:33
For example, the oral cavity, the thyroid: there is thyroid cancer; breast: breast cancer;
0:40
lunch: lung cancer; Stomach: stomach cancer; Uterus: uterine cancer.
0:45
So you name the organ, and there is cancer for that particular organ.
0:51
Broadly, cancer has been described as two types.
0:56
One is solid-organ cancer, another is haematological cancer.
1:00
Solid organ means breast cancer, liver cancer, intestinal cancer: these are all solid organ
1:09
cancers.
1:10
What are haematological cancers?
1:12
These are related to the liquids in our body.
1:16
For example, blood.
1:17
Blood cancer is called haematological cancer.
1:21
The name for blood cancer is leukaemia.
1:24
The cancer of the lymph gland or the lymphatic system, or it is called white blood, is called
1:32
lymphoma.
1:33
There is one more tumour which arises in the bone, which is multiple myeloma.
1:39
Concisely, if I have to put it precisely, as per the organ, the name has been given
1:47
to the cancer.
1:49
Then, there are few cancers which are very fast-growing, few cancers which are in-between,
1:58
and there are few cancers which are slow-growing.
2:01
Depending on the stage, the pace of the growth of the cancer changes.
2:06
Some are high-grade, some are intermediate-grade, and some are low-grade.
2:10
The low-grade cancers, which will spread slowly; intermediate-grade cancer will spread not
2:20
very fast, not very slow; and high-grade cancer will spread very fast.
2:26
So broadly, as per organ, there are cancers: high-grade, intermediate-grade, and low-grade
2:33
cancer.
2:35
Solid-organ cancer, haematological cancers.
2:39
These are roughly types of cancer.
