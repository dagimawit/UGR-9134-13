    <h2 style="margin: 8px; font-style: italic; color: blue;">Here is the  video and text explanation</h2>
    <p id="text">
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;color: black; margin: 15px;">What is heart?</h3> 
        The heart is a fist-sized organ that pumps blood throughout your body.
        It's the primary organ of your circulatory system.
        Your heart contains four main sections (chambers) made of muscle 
        and powered by electrical impulses. Your brain and nervous system direct your hearts function.
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;color: black; margin: 15px;">What is the hearts function?</h3>
        Your hearts main function is to move blood throughout your body. Your heart also:
        Controls the rhythm and speed of your heart rate.
        Maintains your blood pressure.
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;color: black; margin: 15px;">How does your heart work with other organs?</h3>
        Your heart works with other body systems to control your heart rate and other body functions.
        The primary systems are:
        Nervous system: Your nervous system helps control your heart rate.
        It sends signals that tell your heart to beat slower during rest and faster during stress.
        Endocrine system: Your endocrine system sends out hormones.
        These hormones tell your blood vessels to constrict or relax,
        which affects your blood pressure. Hormones from your thyroid gland can also tell
        your heart to beat faster or slower.
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;color: black; margin: 15px;">Where is your heart located?</h3>
        Your heart is located in the front of your chest.
        It sits slightly behind and to the left of your sternum (breastbone).
        Your ribcage protects your heart.
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;color: black; margin: 15px;">How big is your heart?</h3>
        Everyones heart is a slightly different size.
        Generally, adult hearts are about the same size as two clenched fists,
        and childrens hearts are about the same size as one clenched fist.
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;color: black; margin: 15px;">What are the parts of the hearts anatomy?</h3>
        The parts of your heart are like the parts of a house. Your heart has:<br>
        Walls.<br>
        Chambers (rooms).<br>
        Valves (doors).<br>
        Blood vessels (plumbing).<br>
        Electrical conduction system (electricity)<br>
        <p>
          The heart is a fist-sized organ that pumps blood throughout your body.
           It's the primary organ of your circulatory system. Your heart contains 
           four main sections (chambers) made of muscle and powered by electrical impulses. 
          Your brain and nervous system direct your heart's function.

        <p>
          The heart consists of several layers of a tough muscular wall, 
          the myocardium. A thin layer of tissue, the pericardium, covers the outside, 
          and another layer, the endocardium, lines the inside. 
          The heart cavity is divided down the middle into a right and a left heart, 
          which in turn are subdivided into two chambers.
           The upper chamber is called an atrium (or auricle), and 
           the lower chamber is called a ventricle. The two atria act as receiving 
           chambers for blood entering the heart; the more muscular ventricles pump the blood out of the heart.
